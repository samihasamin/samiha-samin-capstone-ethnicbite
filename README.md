# Overview

It serves as a bridge between individuals seeking traditional meals and local caterers or skilled home cooks who specialize in specific cuisines.
Problem Space

# Problem Space

Many immigrants and international students struggle to find affordable and authentic home-cooked meals that reflect their cultural heritage. Restaurants may offer commercialized versions of ethnic dishes, but they often lack the authentic flavors, preparation methods, and affordability of home cooking. EthnicBite aims to address this issue by providing a platform where people can request and order traditional home-cooked meals from verified caterers or home chefs.

# User Profile

Meal Seekers:

Immigrants, international students, and anyone looking for authentic ethnic home-cooked meals.

Require a user-friendly way to browse, request, and order meals.

Caterers/Home Cooks:

Skilled individuals offering home-cooked meals for their community.

Need an easy way to showcase their meals, availability, and pricing.

Require a system to receive and manage meal requests/orders.

Special Considerations:

Ensuring a seamless and intuitive user experience.

Implementing trust and safety features, such as user reviews and verified caterers.

Supporting diverse dietary preferences and restrictions (e.g., vegetarian, halal, gluten-free options)
